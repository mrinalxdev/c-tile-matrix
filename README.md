A high-performance thread pool implementation in C (without pthread.h) featuring work-stealing queues and optimized tiled matrix multiplication.

## 🌟 Features

- **Ultra-lightweight** thread pool (~300 LOC core implementation)
- **Work-stealing** task queues for optimal load balancing
- **Tiled matrix multiplication** with cache-aware optimizations
- **Benchmarked** against pthreads and Go implementations
- **Zero dependencies** (pure C11 standard)
